# PokeStop E-shop ðŸŸ 
This project was developed with the intention to create a functional virtual shop in Vite React, with comunication to an API simulated by the package ```json-server```.

The design made with CSS has the objective of simulating the UI of Nintendo systems e-shops, like the Switch and Wii. Also including background music to better fit the theme.
