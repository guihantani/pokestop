# PokeStop E-shop üü†
This project was developed with the intention to create a functional virtual shop in Vite React, with comunication to an API simulated by the package ```json-server```.

The design made with CSS has the objective of simulating the UI of Nintendo systems e-shops, like the Switch and Wii. Also including background music to better fit the theme.

Obs.: There is a bug in the mobile version of the site where, when changing categories on the products page, the categories bar sits on top of the page. Just clicking the same category that was selected should hide the bar again.
